    "In this analysis, we explored various classification models with the intent of predicting whether a patient is at risk of heart failure based on clinical data and lifestyle factors of individuals. After evaluating multiple models through cross-validation, we selected Logistic Regression as our final model due to its overall superior performance across classification metrics. The model demonstrated promising results on the unseen test set, with an accuracy of 86% and F1-scores of 0.88 for the positive class (at risk) and 0.84 for the negative class (not at risk). From the 276 observations in the test set, the model correctly identified 144 cases at risk and 97 not at risk, reporting 23 false positives and 12 false negatives (cases predicted as not at risk when there is risk). Although the scores are encouraging for a first iteration, there is room for improvement to optimize the hyperparameters and the model's threshold settings to minimize false negative cases, which are critical in medical applications. Overall, this model shows potential to support clinical professionals in the assessment of patients during screening. \n"

    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for an estimate of 19.8 million deaths in 2022 and accounting for one-third of all deaths globally in people under the age of 70 ([World Health Organization, 2025](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds))).  Most CVDs have proven to have a big correlation with an individual’s behavior, habits and environment ([American Heart Association, 2025](https://professional.heart.org/-/media/phd-files-2/science-news/2/2025-heart-and-stroke-stat-update/factsheets/2025-stats-update-fact-sheet-global-burden-of-disease.pdf)). Heart Failure (HF) is a multi-faceted and life-threatening syndrome where the heart’s ability to pump and/or fill with blood is reduced, it is estimated to affect more than 64 million people globally ([Savarese _et al._, 2022](hhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35150240/)). Risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood glucose levels or pre-existing diseases require early intervention to avoid the risk of developing heart failure and other complications. Since many of these risk factors are clinically measurable and changeable, early intervention is highly possible and a critical opportunity in contributing to a patient's well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue leads to the question of whether a machine learning (ML) model could reliably classify patients as ‘at-risk’ or ‘not-at-risk’ for heart failure based on clinical and lifestyle features. The study of this question is important because traditional risk assessment methods tend to overlook the variability and the complexity of the risk factors, meaning that subjectivity from healthcare professionals could also impact the outcome of the assessment ([Barnett _et al._, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7379092/)). Missing the early detection of risk of HF could lead to chronic and progressive conditions associated with increase in mortality and decrease in quality of life. Additionally, ML algorithms could offer significant advantages in predicting risk of HF, when integrating it to clinical practice it could allow for a more personalized treatment for the patient ([Kokori _et al._, 2025](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39656330/)). \n"

    "The [dataset](https://epl.di.uminho.pt/~jcr/AULAS/ATP2021/datasets/heart.csv)  used in this project is pulled from a repository of the [University of Minho,  Portugal](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/student-life/campi/Pages/Description.aspx). The dataset was created by Federico Soriano Palacios (2021), it integrates five different heart-related datasets combined over 11 common features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. The five data sets are part of the [“Heart Disease” dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) (Janosi _et al._, 1989) that can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository  that is originally sourced from the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, the University Hospital of Zurich, the University Hospital of Basel, the V.A. Medical Center of Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Each row of the dataset contains 11 attributes that describe the patient’s age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG result, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, and the presence or absence of heart disease. \n",

    "To build the classification model for the prediction of heart failure risk, an exploratory data analysis was conducted. Considering the distribution of the data, the features and their correlation to the target variable, it was decided to include all of them in the model with some standardization to improve results. Data was split into 70% for the training set and 30% for the test set. Different approaches were taken to evaluate which model would have the best accuracy in classification.  We trained five different models, including Decision Tree, k-nearest neighbors (k-nn), Support Vector Machine (SVC) with an RBF kernel, Logistic Regression, and a Dummy Classifier (baseline). Each of the models were evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model with the highest performance scores across all metrics is the Logistic Regression which is the model that will be used for the rest of the project. The Python programming language (Van Rossum and Drake 2009) and the following Python packages were used to perform the analysis: NumPy (Harris et al. 2020), pandas (McKinney 2010), Matplotlib (Hunter 2007), seaborn (Waskom 2021), Altair (VanderPlas et al. 2018), scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011), and requests (Reitz 2011)."

    "The initial results of the Logistic Regression prediction model on the test set showed good performance across all metrics, as detailed in Table 2. This matched our expectations based on the cross-validation results, indicating that the model would generalize well on unseen data. This is already a positive outcome for a first iteration of the model and provides a solid foundation for further improvements. It also has the potential to be useful as a support tool for clinical screening of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the hyperparameter tuning that will be explored on future stages, this use case is well suited for Precision-Recall and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to further evaluate the model's threshold settings and trade-offs between precision and recall. This is a medical-related application, and it is crucial to minimize false negatives i.e., predicting a patient is not at risk when they actually are. Also, making the probability scores available for the predictions could increase the model's utility, supporting the decision-making of healthcare professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we could review the features coefficients from the Logistic Regression model to understand their influence on the predictions, enabling to better interpret the model's decisions and confirm if we could drop any features in future iterations."
