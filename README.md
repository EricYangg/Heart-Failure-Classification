# Heart Failure Classification

Authors: Omar Ramos, Mara Sanchez, Eric Yang

## About

In this analysis, we explored various classification models with the intent of predicting whether a patient is at risk of heart failure based on clinical data and lifestyle factors of individuals. After evaluating multiple models through cross-validation, we selected Logistic Regression as our final model due to its overall superior performance across classification metrics. The model demonstrated promising results on the unseen test set, with an accuracy of 86% and F1-scores of 0.88 for the positive class (at risk) and 0.84 for the negative class (not at risk). From the 276 observations in the test set, the model correctly identified 144 cases at risk and 97 not at risk, reporting 23 false positives and 12 false negatives (cases predicted as not at risk when there is risk). Although the scores are encouraging for a first iteration, there is room for improvement to optimize the hyperparameters and the model's threshold settings to minimize false negative cases, which are critical in medical applications. Overall, this model shows potential to support clinical professionals in the assessment of patients during screening. 

The [dataset](https://epl.di.uminho.pt/~jcr/AULAS/ATP2021/datasets/heart.csv) used in this project is pulled from a repository of the [University of Minho,  Portugal](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/student-life/campi/Pages/Description.aspx). The dataset was created by Federico Soriano Palacios (2021), it integrates five different heart-related datasets combined over 11 common features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. The five data sets are part of the [“Heart Disease” dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) (Janosi _et al._, 1989) that can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository  that is originally sourced from the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, the University Hospital of Zurich, the University Hospital of Basel, the V.A. Medical Center of Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Each row of the dataset contains 11 attributes that describe the patient’s age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG result, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, and the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Dependencies

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VS Code Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

## Usage (Docker)

To reproduce the analysis using docker's container, follow the instructions below:

#### Setup

1. [Install](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and launch Docker on your computer.
2. Clone this GitHub repository.

#### Running the analysis

1. Navigate to the root of this project on your computer using the command line and enter the following command to reset the project to a clean state (i.e., remove all files generated by previous runs of the analysis):

```
docker-compose up
```

2. In the terminal, look for a URL that starts with `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=`
(for an example, see the highlighted text in the terminal below). 
Copy and paste that URL into your browser.

3. To run the analysis, open `notebooks/heart_disease_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab you just launched and under the "Kernel" menu click "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells..."

#### Clean up

1. To shut down the container and clean up the resources, type `Ctrl` + `C` in the terminal where you launched the container, and then type `docker compose rm`

## Developer notes

#### Developer dependencies

- `conda` (version 23.9.0 or higher)
- `conda-lock` (version 2.5.7 or higher)

### Adding a new dependency

1. Add the dependency to the `environment.yml` file on a new branch.

2. Run `conda-lock -k explicit --file environment.yml -p linux-64` to update the `conda-linux-64.lock` file.

2. Re-build the Docker image locally to ensure it builds and runs properly.

3. Push the changes to GitHub. A new Docker image will be built and pushed to Docker Hub automatically. It will be tagged with the SHA for the commit that changed the file.

4. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file on your branch to use the new container image (make sure to update the tag specifically).

5. Send a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch.

## Usage (conda-lock)

1. For the first time running the project **locally**, install the conda lock from the root of this repository:

``` bash
conda-lock install --name heart-failure-classification conda-lock.yml
```
2. Switch to the project's environment by running the following line from the terminal:

``` bash
conda activate heart-failure-classification
```

3. To run the analysis, open Jupyter Lab from the root of this repository:

``` bash
jupyter lab 
```

4. Open `notebooks/heart_disease_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab and under `Switch/Select Kernel` choose "Python [conda env:heart-failure-classification]".

Next, under the "Kernel" menu click "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...".
